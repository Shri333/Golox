# golox

Tree-walk interpreter for the Lox programming language (based on [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com)).

To build the interpreter (using a modern Go toolchain), run `go build` in the root directory of this repository.
From there, run `./golox` with the name of the Lox source file (or without a source file to start the REPL).

This interpreter is not fully compliant (does not exactly match the Java version).

Thank you Bob Nystrom for writing such an excellent book!
